# Test Charter
> This document will describe the agenda for testing and define the primary goal for the session.
>
> If you are testing with a charter, you are testing without the use of test cases and are therefore performing exploratory testing!
## Exploratory Testing
> Testing on the fly without test cases or scenarios to determine how the software behaves. It is clicking around to see what happens, but
- *Identify* a target area, feature or API
- *Use* specific tools or technologies to test
- *Discover* specific information from your tests

# Test Charter
> This document will describe the agenda for testing and define the primary goal for the session.
>
> If you are testing with a charter, you are testing without the use of test cases and are therefore performing exploratory testing!
## Exploratory Testing
> Testing on the fly without test cases or scenarios to determine how the software behaves. It is clicking around to see what happens, but it is goal oriented testing with some thought and direction.
- *Identify* a target area, feature or API
- *Use* specific tools or an approach to test
- *Discover* specific information from your tests
### Identify
> What specific feature or area of the application are you targeting for discovery? Is it user authentication or maybe a backend service?
### Use
> What testing tools will be used, or better yet - what approach will be implemented? An approach is an overall theme to keep the charter focused.

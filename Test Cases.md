# Test Cases
> This document will describe the scenarios and steps that will be performed to validate functionality and determine an expected outcome.
> Test cases are a collection of scenarios or a single scenario and 
## Scenarios
> Scenarios are simply functionality that can be tested. They help drive your testing by stepping through an application the way a user would. Thinking like a user and determining as many real-world scenarios as possible will lead to more complete test coverage.
## Steps and Expected Results
> Scenarios should always have two things: Steps that are the instructions or **actions** taken by the tester and **expected outcomes**. Each step should lead to an expected behavior. If it doesn't, you may have discovered a defect.

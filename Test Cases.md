# Test Cases
> This document will describe the scenarios and steps that will be performed to validate functionality and determine an expected outcome.
## Scenarios
> Scenarios are simply functionality that can be tested. They help drive your testing by stepping through an application the way a user would. Thinking like a user and determining as many real-world scenarios as possible will lead to more complete test coverage.
## Steps and Expected Results

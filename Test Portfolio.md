## Test Plan
> everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth

## Test Strategy
> coverage and quality

## Functional Tests
> Does the software work according to *specifications* and is it behaving in a manner that is *expected*?
### Unit Testing
> Work with the DEVs to cover some scenarios up front at build time
- Arrange
- Act
- Assert
### Exploratory Testing
> Testing on the fly without test cases or scenarios to determine how the software behaves
- *Identify* a target area, feature or API
- *Use* specific tools or technologies to test
- *Discover* specific information from your tests
### API Testing
> Hit those endpoints and validate that requests/responses are working as expected
- Postman
### Regression Testing
> Does the software still work as expected after changes?

## SQL
> It's critical to understand how the data flows between applications
### Data Generation
> Do you have proper test data for your scenarios? You may need to create it
### Stored Procedures and Views
> Are queries performant and returning data as expected?
## Defect Tracking
> It's critical to log any repeatable error as a defect and provide as much supporting information as possible
### JIRA
